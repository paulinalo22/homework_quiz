# homework_quiz
This assignment consisted of creating a fun quiz that can hopefully adapt to multiple screen sizes. The purpose of this activity is to prove that I have a slight understanding of Wed APIs. My quiz is about the EXTREMELY predictable and clich√©d topic of movies, TV and everything in between. The title is "We're gonna need a bigger quiz".
